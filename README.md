# How to use Git

## commit

1. working copy - unstaged files
2. add - move a file to staged files
3. index, staging area - staged files
4. commit - create a new version with the files in the staging area

## discard

- unchange the file to the last commit

## reset

- reset current branch to a certain commit
- hard : discard all working copy changes
- mixed : keep working copy but reset index
